# Changelog

Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Entries in English from now on.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Unified morning view ("Buongiorno", key `P`): today context (counts, load, yesterday, streak) plus the smart proposal with inline reasons and confirm in a single screen, no print (the plan on disk is the real document)
- Buongiorno explains its additive semantics (already planned stay, Esc writes nothing) and the summary counts items to confirm, already planned and excluded

### Fixed
- State picker is now a 2x2 grid with arrow-key navigation and Enter to choose; labels carry no key hints and the unbound `1`/`2`/`3`/`O`/`P`/`X` shortcuts are gone (legend: arrows move, Enter chooses, Esc cancels)
- State picker title states the current state plainly and marks it with `●`, focusing its button
- Buongiorno empty state always shown when there is nothing to plan (was silently missing)
- Buongiorno content scrolls with pinned legend and buttons, so the frame holds on small terminals
- Buongiorno proposal labels use an em-dash for over-capacity/dismissed flags instead of extra parentheses
- Post-confirm notification reports added, already present and postponed counts
- Removed dead morning briefing / smart plan duplication (single `plan_day` call, no fake `P`/`m` hints in modals)
- Evening report hint now states the real steps (close, then `R` for day closing)
- Briefing and smart-plan popups use the shared modal frame; day closing uses the fixed-frame pattern (list no longer overflows on small terminals)
- Buongiorno proposal labels no longer show internal `#id` and omit empty `()` so reasons are not cut off by the terminal width

### Removed
- Morning-only briefing keys and menu entries (`menu_plan_*`, `menu_brief_*`, `brief_m_title/empty/sec_top/hint`)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added
- Recommended workflow guide: first Day menu entry with a 5-step daily checklist (quick add, morning, day, evening, week)
- Natural-language capture in form (`ctrl+l`) and `tasko add "<phrase>"` with `#tag *project !prio ~estimate //note`
- Smart day planner (`P`) with hour capacity plus morning briefing and evening report
- Agenda view: chronological radar for overdue, today, tomorrow, next 7 days and important undated tasks
- Manual iCal (`.ics`) export for active tasks with due dates
- `TodoStore`: central todo container with id lookup, mutations and single `commit()` write path
- Inter-process file locking (fcntl) with timeout for all state saves
- Three-way per-id merge on save: CLI and TUI no longer overwrite each other
- Tests: `test_store.py`, `test_concurrency.py`, `test_failure_paths.py`

### Fixed
- Day menu now groups temporal views together (agenda, plans, week, calendar, briefings/review)
- Locked (encrypted, no key) files no longer faked as corrupt `.corrotto.json` backups
- CLI `add`/`done` go through the store (lock + merge)

### Removed
- Dead code: write-only `_trash`, unbound `action_toggle_theme`, duplicated `_apply_startup_lang`
- Stale `build/` artifacts untracked (now git-ignored with caches and `dist/`)


### Added (sprint 5)
- Day closing review: today summary (done vs goal, pomodoros) and tomorrow plan picker with top-3 preselection (menu entry, no new global key)
